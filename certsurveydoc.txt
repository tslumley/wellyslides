          1994 Survey of ASA Membership on 
                    Certification
                          
          by Bert Gunter, Chair, Interim Certification Committee

Note: Uwe Koehn and Ron Snee, the other members of the
certification committee, assisted in the data analysis and preparation
of this report.

     Below are the results of the ASA survey on certification. Five
thousand responses, or about 1/4 of ASA membership, were received. 
Because these results are not based on a scientific sample survey and
because we on this committee do not claim to be experts in survey
analysis, we have made no attempt to do any extensive modeling of
how the results might be associated with the demographics beyond the
few brief comments that  follow. For readers interested in such
matters, the  ascii file, certsurvey.dat,  in the ASACERT archive on
Statlib contains the raw response data. Format information can be
found in the file, certsurvey.fmt.

The marginal totals from the ASA survey are:

Should the ASA develop some form of certification?
          YES                 1,321
          POSSIBLY            1,114

          NO RESPONSE            42

every several years?

          POSSIBLY              936

     In brief, interpreting YES or POSSIBLY as positive and
UNLIKELY or NO as negative, it is clear from the first question that
respondents were split nearly evenly for and against the general
concept of certification, although it is also clear that those against
were decidedly more negative than those for were positive. The
response to the second question shows somewhat less support and
considerably greater fence-sitting regarding the specific certification
program that has been proposed. This may reflect a lack of familiarity
among some members with the details as well as the view that the
proposal requires improvement.  A bit puzzling is the fact that there
were fewer NO's for this question than for the first, as one would
expect that those unequivocally opposed to the concept of certifica
tion would also oppose a specific proposal for it.  The results from the
remaining questions are self-explanatory.

     One hypothesis that might be entertained is that the survey
responses would tend to follow demographic lines that reflect the
different occupations and interests of the respondents. Two ways to
examine this hypothesis would be to see how responses depended on
the two questions asking for primary work area (Industry, Academia,
Government, Other) and job description (Researcher, Educator,
Consultant, Practitioner, Student, Other). As a rough indication, one
might hypothesize that those more involved in day-to-day practice
would generally favor certification more than those who are primarily
involved in research and education (clearly, there are many potential
pitfalls in such an oversimplified dichotomy). A quick way to look at
this is to dichotomize the work area as Industry/Government versus
Academia, and dichotomize job description as Consultant/Practitioner
versus Researcher/Educator/Student (we note that there were only
188 respondents who identified themselves as students, so the possible
ambiguities there have little effect). Here are those results, further
categorized by highest educational degree (B= Bachelor's or less, M=
Master's, P = PhD). YES = Yes or Possibly; NO = Unlikely or No.
Note that the numbers do not add up because of different amounts of
nonresponses for the different demographic questions:

     Cons/Pract          Res/Educ/Student
     B    M    P         B    M    P
YES  88   538  459       66   317  925
NO   60   431  449       50   243  1006

     Ind/Govt       Academia
     B    M    P         B    M    P
YES  117  656  538       34   194  839
NO   85   530  617       28   144  839

     These simple results do not indicate any strong association
between views on certification (as measured by the first question) and 
respondents'  occupations. Another way that one might consider this
question is by categorizing on section membership. For those cases in
which primary section membership was recorded and for those
sections with more than ten total responses, results were (from most
positive to most negative):

 Section  YES       NO

  QP      222       118
  MR       44        31
  EN       94        68
  CE       99        72
  CM      175       134
  PE      231       197
  TH       51         46
  BI      477       455
  SR      140       134
  BP      255       250
  BE      246       249
  GV        98      125
  SS      117       154
  BA       60        84
  SG       11        18

The strong positive response in the QP (Quality and Productivity)
section and the rather negative responses in the GV (Government), SS
(Social Statistics), and BA (Bayesian) sections stand out. A standard
contingency table analysis gives a chi-squared value of 58  (14 df) for
the whole table of which 23.8 is due to QP, 5.9 to GV, 8.6 to SS, and
6.3 to BA.  Obviously, more sophisticated analyses could be done, but
we shall leave these delights to others.     

     Finally, readers will have noticed the association of responses
with academic degree. Simply categorizing on this factor. the results
for the first question are, in percentages:
               
          B,M  PhD  
                    
YES       53%  46%  
NO        41%  48.5%
N/O        6%   5.5%
               
Clearly, non-PhD's are more positive about certification than PhD's. 

===============================================================
The format of the raw data
===============================================================
The file is in ascii format.
Each record consists of 13 contiguous fields corresponding to the
13 questions. Blanks indicate missing data. Fields 1-5 and 9-12 are
1 character wide. Fields 6-8 and 13 are 2 characters wide. In field
1-5,  1 = yes, 2 = possibly, etc. and 0 = no response. Fields 6-8
give the two letter acronyms for sections in the survey.  Fields 9-
12 give one letter initials corresponding to each question s
choices. Field 13 gives the number of years of membership in
ASA.
